# Shades Of IceCream (Django Project)
In this project we use python-Django Framework. Use Bootstrap for design and some css for styling. we use database as sqlite3 in contact form.

**Note :** This is not a fully-fledged website. Landing page and Contact page is funtional, other pages can also be implemented in similar way.

## static directory
it contains all static assets like css and pictures and required screenshots

## template directory
In this directory we define all our templatye pages such as contact page, about us, services page and base.html as well

## base.html
base.html in template directory is a base file which serve the common layout in all pages such as navbars and footer.
we also defines block in base.html and use it in other pages. It is the concept of **template inheritance**
